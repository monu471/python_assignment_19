    "In Python, encapsulation is achieved through naming conventions rather than strict access modifiers like in some other programming languages. Python supports a level of encapsulation by using naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility of variables and methods. However, there are no strict mechanisms to enforce access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses naming conventions to indicate the visibility and accessibility of variables and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Public: Variables and methods that are intended to be accessed from outside the class are typically named using lowercase letters or words separated by underscores (e.g., `my_variable`, `my_method()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Protected: Variables and methods that are intended to be accessed within the class and its subclasses are typically named with a single leading underscore (e.g., `_my_variable`, `_my_method()`). This indicates that they are intended for internal use but can still be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Private: Variables and methods that are intended to be accessed only within the class itself are typically named with a double leading underscore (e.g., `__my_variable`, `__my_method()`). This indicates that they are intended for internal use and should not be accessed or overridden outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that these naming conventions are not enforced by the Python language itself. They serve as a guideline for developers to indicate the intended visibility and accessibility of class members. However, Python does not prevent direct access to variables or methods with any of these naming conventions.\n",

    "In Python, there is a concept of \"we're all consenting adults here,\" meaning that developers are trusted to respect these naming conventions and not access or modify private or protected members directly. The focus is on providing clear guidelines and relying on the developer's responsibility to adhere to them.\n",
